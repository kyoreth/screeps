lets play screeps

what do we want to do:
run many rooms efficiently,
  that is to say, we want to get resources and
    kill enemies.


Goals per room:
-make creeps suited for different roles.
-regenerate dead creep
-create more creeps as resources allow and space.
-kill enemies in room//defend
-build structures like roads //towers automatically
